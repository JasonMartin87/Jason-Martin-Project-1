- List all the types of downloaded files that have been identified for the last 7 days, along with a short description of each file type (use Google if you aren't sure about a particular file type).

deb: debian, linux compressed package.

rpm: similar to deb, but used for red hat enterprises.


3. Now that you have a feel for the data, Let's dive a bit deeper. Look at the chart that shows Unique Visitors Vs. Average Bytes.

- Locate the time frame in the last 7 days with the most amount of bytes (activity).
